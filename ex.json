  text: '\'\'\'\'\'Como Ama una Mujer\'\'\'\'\' () is the fifth studio album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was first released on March 23, 2007 by Epic Records. The album received generally mixed to some positive reviews, critics deemed this album more vocally better than her previous ones, however others questioned a lack of highlights within \'\'Como Ama una mujer\'\'.   Inspiration and development  thumb|left|150px|Lopez\'s husband Marc Anthony inspired her to record a Spanish album. He co-produced the majority of the album, alongside Estefano.  Plans for Lopez to release a Spanish-language album materialized in 2004, when Lopez\'s then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album \'\'Amar Sin Mentiras\'\' (2004) with Estefano and Julio Reyes. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled "Escapemonos", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song so much that she decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years.<ref name="She is woman"></ref> Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single "If You Had My Love", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. According to Lopez: "My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side."<ref name="Sawfnews"></ref> Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album \'\'Rebirth\'\' (2005).<ref name="Rebirth Allmusic"></ref>  In early 2006 it was announced that Lopez would release her first Spanish album and her fifth studio album \'\'Como Ama una Mujer\'\' later that year.<ref name="2006 Billboard"></ref> According to Estefano, \'\'Como Ama una Mujer\'\' will "prove critics wrong" from its "big songs that require a voice"; referring to the critics about Lopez having a "limited" vocal tone.<ref name="Contactmusic Rebirth"></ref><ref name="Contactmusic Spanish"></ref>  After working on the album, Lopez said that she matured as singer, continuing by stating that: "Marc gave me confidence in the studio as well. When someone believes in you so much, you don\'t want to let them down. And it\'s also the material. I think this material lent itself to my voice. And it actually made me approach my new English album in a different way. I have a different standard now".<ref name="She is woman"/>   Promotion  For promotion of \'\'Como Ama Una Mujer\'\', Lopez traveled with her husband, Marc Athony, back to the Bronx, to meet fans and sign copies of her album in her old neighborhood.<ref name=hometown></ref> Over 500 people attended.<ref name=hometown /> In an interview, Lopez stated "It touches my heart to be able to bring this album back to my neighborhood, back to my home."<ref name=promotealbum></ref>   Critical reception   The album currently has a score of 45 out of 100 from Metacritic, based on mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who agreed that Lopez\'s vocals had improved.<ref name=meta/> \'\'The York Press\'\', on the album, stated that "Lopez stunned many with her Spanish language Como Ama una Mujer, which at last proved that she is a major musical force."<ref name=compare></ref>  In his review of \'\'Como ama una Mujer\'\', Tom Patrick said "If you like Lopez and her music, then youll likely find her new CD enjoyable. It\'s good to dance to, has some emotional tunes and a bit of variety, and the Spanish influence reaches beyond the vocals into the music. If you dont like J.Lo, however, you might find yourself wishing the album were as abbreviated as her nickname."<ref></ref> Chris Willman from \'\'Entertainment Weekly\'\' gave the album a C+, saying: "Passions run high and pulses low on this almost entirely balladic collection, which seems ripe for a series of videos full of heartbroken hair-brushing [...] \'\'Como Ama\'\' does represent a victory for Lopez by offering fairly persuasive proof that, contrary to rumor, she can sing, and without a regiment of background choralists. All that bulking up she\'s been doing at the vocal gym isn\'t enough, though, to turn flaccid torch songs into muscle. The production/writing team of Estefano, Julio Reyes, and Marc Anthony mixes slight flamenco flavoring with assists from the London Symphony Orchestra; passable easy-listening-\'\'en-espanol\'\' weepies like "Me Haces Falta" don\'t begin to live up to their florid, romance-novel lyrics ("\'\'La verdad, estoy mal/Es sufrir, es gritar\'\'" translation: "The truth is I hurt/I\'m suffering, I\'m screaming"). Torpor, it turns out, really is the universal language."<ref name="EW"/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said "She acquits herself well as a vocalist  she never indulges in vocal gymnastics, and she can carry a tune strongly". He also said the album wasn\'t as "daring as Shakira."<ref name=all />  James Reed from \'\'The Boston Globe\'\' gave the album a positive review"\'Como Ama Una Mujer\' in spite of its soft-focus romantic leanings, is a sincere album, organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics [...] for what is surely Lopez\'s most tasteful and reserved album yet. She\'s still Jenny from the block, only now the block has moved out of the gritty Bronx onto a quiet side street in the burbs. Lopez is far too savvy to make a straight ballads album, though. Her idea of a love song is more classic, opting for string sections over canned synthesizers. Yes, that\'s a real-life piano opening the title track, with a minor-chord progression that sounds oddly similar to Randy Newman\'s "In Germany Before the War." A delicate ballad with a simmering introduction, it opens wide to an over-the-top chorus that would sound best sung in unison by an arena of swaying fans, illuminated cellphones hoisted."<ref name=boston></ref>  Commercial performance \'\'Como Ama una Mujer\'\' debuted at number 10 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200<ref></ref> Jennifer Lopez is one of only few performers to debut in the top-ten of the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 with a Spanish-language album (Other artists who achieved this are Shakira  who to this date holds the record for highest debut for a Spanish-language album  Mana, Juanes, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, Wisin & Yandel and Selena). It sold a total of 48,000 copies in its opening week.<ref></ref>  \'\'Como ama una Mujer\'\' marks the highest debut sales in the United States for a Spanish album and the highest digital sales for a Spanish album.<ref name=recordrecord></ref> It went straight to number one in Switzerland.<ref name=recordrecord />  The album also stayed atop the \'\'Billboard\'\' Latin Albums Chart for 4 consecutive weeks; spending 26 weeks on the chart before leaving the top 100. With the Univision airing of the drama TV-series \'\'Como Ama Una Mujer\'\' featuring songs from the album, the album went back to the chart, hitting the #67 position after Lopez\'s performance of "Por Que te marchas" on the 3rd episode of the show. The album reached the top ten in Germany, Greece, Spain and Italy.  By August 2007, the album had sold over 800,000 copies worldwide.<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6841042/Jennifer-Lopez-Set-to-Release.html Jennifer Lopez Set to Release Her Highly Anticipated New Album Brave on October 9, 2007.]</ref> As of October 2010, it has sold 207,000 copies in the United States.<ref></ref>   Track listing    Personnel  thumb|right|189px|Marc Anthony (\'\'right\'\'), Lopez\'s then-husband, co-wrote five songs that appeared on the final track-listing of \'\'Como ama una Mujer\'\'. * Vic Anesini  Mastering * Marc Anthony  Arranger, Vocals (background), Producer, Executive Producer * Eduardo Avena  Percussion * Odisa Beltran  Production Coordination * Andres Bermudez  Mixing * Marco Britti  Drums * Jorge Calandrelli  String Arrangements * Cesar Castillo  Quena, Sikus * Jose Garcia De La Rosa  Engineer * Sebastian DePeyrecave  Guitar, Assistant Engineer * Nailton Bispo "Meia Noiche" Dos Santos  Percussion * Tony Duran  Photography * Vicky Echeverri  Vocals (background) * Estefano  Vocals (background), Producer * Mauricio Gasca  Arranger, Programming and Recording Engineer * Armando Gola  Bass * Mario Guini  Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar, Guitar (Electric) * Anthony Kilhoffer  Engineer * Jadi Leesley  Stylist * The London Symphony Orchestra  Strings * Jennifer Lopez  Executive Producer * Juan Jose "Chaqueno" Martinez  Percussion * Pedro Namerow  Assistant Engineer * Jose Luis Pagan  Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar, Arranger, Guitar (Electric), Keyboards, Programming, Engineer * Jose Luis Pagani  Arranger, Programming * Ricardo Tiki Pasillas  Percussion, Drums, Vocals (background) * Ken Paves  Hair Stylist * Julian Peploe  Art Direction, Design * Erben Perez  Bass * Gustavo Pichon Dal Pont  Engineer * Julio C.
